# Agent Provider SDK

Shared infrastructure for external binaries that implement the
`oulipoly.provider/v1` Agent Runner contract.

The SDK is intended to centralize the parts every terminal provider needs:

- versioned request/response and launch-event types;
- expressive, versioned Session and Agent DSLs;
- bounded live-stream and infrastructure-evidence contracts;
- JSON/NDJSON process transport;
- subprocess containment, custody, cancellation, and durable state helpers;
- a provider-profile DSL with capability negotiation and validation;
- central system-prompt and tool-bridge policy, including the Agent Bash bridge;
- conformance fixtures and a reproducible memory benchmark harness.

Terminal-specific behavior remains in provider repositories. OpenCode, Pi,
Codex, and Claude Code adapters continue to own their native command lines,
authentication, account/config roots, quota APIs, and session formats.

Agent Runner remains the authority for logical agent/session ancestry,
scheduling, runtime request/session admission, pause/resume policy, mailbox
delivery, and incident classification. Agent Bash remains the generic
detached-process supervisor and output capture owner. The SDK supplies shared
contracts and conformance tests; it does not create a second runtime registry or
session database.

## Provider contract

The `agent-provider-contract` crate pins the current
`oulipoly.provider/v1` request, response, and launch-event contract. It exposes:

- a checked-in Rust DTO projection of the pinned schemas;
- the complete JSON Schema registry and validation helpers;
- strict launch-NDJSON correlation, ordering, base64, and finality validation;
- deterministic conformance fixtures through the `contract-test-fixtures`
  feature; and
- source identities and SHA-256 provenance in
  `crates/provider-contract/contract/v1/UPSTREAM.md`.

Public DTOs preserve schema-defined names and bounded fields. When the pinned
schema deliberately leaves an operation's whole parameter object open, the SDK
still exposes a distinct operation-specific parameter type and contains the open
content in `extension_fields`; the fixture vocabulary is not promoted into a
private constraint. `LaunchEvent` is the canonical typed launch-event sum and
its variants wrap the five schema-specific event DTOs. `src/generated.rs` is
maintained with the complete snapshot; the JSON Schemas remain the wire authority.
The imported launch schema's intrinsic phrase "request, event, and result
schemas" names the terminal `exit` event as the launch result; launch has no
separate result or response envelope.

Downstream hosts and providers should consume the released crate or copy the
complete versioned snapshot. Private schema edits are unsupported. This contract
does not own provider execution or Agent Runner's logical session state.

The `oulipoly.provider/v1` compatibility promise governs wire behavior, not the
Rust source API independently exposed by the crate. Rust consumers also select a
crate package version: source-compatible evolution follows Cargo's semantic
versioning rules, and a source-breaking DTO or operation-typing change requires
an appropriate package-version change even when its admitted wire JSON remains
compatible with provider/v1. Before `1.0.0`, a minor package-version change may
break the Rust API. Consumers that copy only the schema snapshot receive the wire
contract, not a Rust source-compatibility promise.

Provider responses can carry typed host-state proposals required by the pinned
wire snapshot. Those values are untrusted proposals, not executable commands:
Agent Runner validates authority and state preconditions, then translates an
accepted proposal into its private mutation protocol. Providers do not apply
host state, and schema or DTO admission alone never authorizes mutation.

One active host/provider route must use the same complete v1 snapshot on both
sides. Mixed-snapshot operation under the shared `oulipoly.provider/v1`
discriminator is unsupported. Before rollout, the route owner must be able to
keep the previous matched pair available through replacement verification and
the rollback decision. If it cannot meet that prerequisite, the upgrade does not
start and the route continues on its previous pair. Exact snapshot coherence
takes priority over independently upgrading peers that merely share the v1
discriminator, even when a revision is otherwise wire-compatible; mixed
revisions are not an availability fallback. Rollback restores the retained
previous pair as one unit.

The crate and its complete schema snapshot may be used and redistributed under
the MIT License, which is included in `crates/provider-contract` and in the
published crate. The imported schemas' source MIT grant and preserved notice are
recorded in `crates/provider-contract/contract/v1/UPSTREAM.md`.

The session runtime and infrastructure control-plane direction is documented in
[`docs/architecture/session-runtime-control-plane.md`](docs/architecture/session-runtime-control-plane.md).
Its implementation is tracked by APV-28 through APV-36 in the existing Agent
Provider SDK and Provider Runtime and Memory projects. Live output is deliberately
active-only and bounded; completed turns remain canonical in normal session
storage.

## Provider memory harness

`provider-memory` measures a complete Linux process tree using
`/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup`. Reports keep RSS and PSS separate so shared pages are
not presented as private provider cost. They also record private/shared memory,
swap, process roles, PID start times, executable SHA-256, and caller-supplied
non-secret version/config identities. Time-series retention is bounded by
`--max-samples` (default 4096); peak totals still include samples dropped from
the retained tail.

```bash
# One point-in-time sample of an existing Agent Runner process tree
cargo run -p agent-provider-memory -- snapshot --root-pid 12345

# Bounded time series for an existing process tree
cargo run -p agent-provider-memory -- attach \
  --root-pid 12345 --duration-ms 5000 --interval-ms 100 \
  --identity terminal_version=1.18.23

# Launch and measure a workload. Child stdout/stderr stay attached; the report
# is written atomically to the requested path and never records child argv.
cargo run -p agent-provider-memory -- run \
  --output ./memory-report.json --interval-ms 100 \
  --identity workload=bash-only -- /usr/bin/sleep 1
```

Attach to the long-lived `agents`/Agent Runner PID rather than a short-lived
provider bridge. Descendant discovery follows parent relationships and therefore
continues across child-created process groups, including native terminal, LSP,
and MCP children.
