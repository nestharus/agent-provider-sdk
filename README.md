# Agent Provider SDK

Shared infrastructure for external binaries that implement the
`oulipoly.provider/v1` Agent Runner contract.

The SDK is intended to centralize the parts every terminal provider needs:

- versioned request/response and launch-event types;
- JSON/NDJSON process transport;
- subprocess containment, custody, cancellation, and durable state helpers;
- a provider-profile DSL with capability negotiation and validation;
- central system-prompt and tool-bridge policy, including the Agent Bash bridge;
- conformance fixtures and a reproducible memory benchmark harness.

Terminal-specific behavior remains in provider repositories. OpenCode, Pi,
Codex, and Claude Code adapters continue to own their native command lines,
authentication, account/config roots, quota APIs, and session formats.

## Status

Bootstrap phase. The first work units will pin the current external-provider
contract, add conformance fixtures, and establish a process-tree memory baseline
before reusable modules are extracted from `agent-runner-opencode`.
